simple chess game.
to run cd to folder and run board.py with python3
pieces can be replaced if desired. Just keep the filenames
the same and in the same folder. Should work if jpg and not png but unsure.
For now there is no collision detection. If I am bored and feel like adding
a bunch of if's I may come back to it but for now. I'm good

Dependencies:
PIL
pygame
